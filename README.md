## Initially running the Solution
If you get an error related to csc.exe the first time you run the solution in Visual Studio.  You can fix this by cleaning the solution.

## Part 1

This section of the test is focussed on coding and engineering practices. We want you to show off your skills, so do what you think is best for a good experience and well-written application.

We have intentionally left some parts of it open-ended so you can solve it in the way you think is most appropriate (even using front-end code if you want to). You can also refactor parts if necessary.

Please use the external css and js files that we have provided if you wish to work in these areas. We are not looking for the use of **lots** of libraries. We want to see how you would code this. However, if you would use a library for certain bits of it, feel free, but explain why.


1. Add a line total to each product line and an order total at the bottom of the page.

2. Add the ability to return items on the order

    2.1  You will need to add a way to select the item(s).
  
    2.2  The form should submit with a post, but how you feedback success to the customer is up to you.
  
    2.3  Please add some simple validation to the form. It only needs to make sure that an item has been selected.

    2.4  Show how much money is due to be refunded.

    2.5  If all items are selected for return, then the delivery cost should also be refunded.
    
3. Tell us what else would you do, if you were to spend more time on this. Are there areas you want to improve, add or extend?

## Part 2

This section of the test requires no coding, just a bit of thinking and writing. You will find a document, `Software Engineer take-home test, part 2`, in the root of this directory.

Provide your answer as written text, in whatever format you prefer. Write as much or as little as you like, but do know that we love getting into the detail of things.
